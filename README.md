# USA Cars Dataset Analysis with Tableau 🚗📊

Welcome to the USA Cars Dataset Analysis repository! In this project, a dataset containing information about American cars from the 1970s to 1982 has been imported. The dataset includes attributes such as mpg, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and car name. The analysis involves using Tableau to create visualizations that illustrate the relationships between certain attributes and showcase patterns over time.
